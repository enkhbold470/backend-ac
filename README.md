# EnergyMate - Electricity Consumption Reducer IoT Solution

Welcome to the ESP32 IoT project repository! This project combines the power of ESP32 microcontrollers, Proteus simulation, Arduino programming, Git version control, Postman for API testing, and DigitalOcean for cloud deployment. This was all done and made during the DA Hacks 2023 Hackathon from 10/20/2023 to 10/21/2023.

## Requirements

- Arduino IDE
- Proteus
- Git
- Postman
- DigitalOcean Account
- ThingSpeak API

**Big Roadblocks we encountered and overcame:**

- SQLite unable to be connected with our DigitalOcean Server.
- Had to scale down the project several times.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/connor-petri/EnergyMate.git
```

Set up Arduino IDE for ESP32 development.

## Goals

### Short-term Goal

Our current mission is to increase awareness about the financial aspects related to using electronic devices, giving people the knowledge and resources to not only save electricity but also protect their finances. By shedding light on the connection between energy consumption and financial impact, our goal is to promote responsible energy use and ensure a brighter future for everyone.

### Long-Term Goal

Our grand, long-term vision is to make a significant contribution to the global battle against climate change. We're striving to achieve this by providing a groundbreaking and effective approach to conserving electricity. In the process, our aim is to be a part of the solution that helps safeguard the Earth's invaluable resources, promoting sustainability and ensuring a healthy environment for generations to come.

## Usage

- Open the Arduino IDE and upload the provided ESP32 code to your microcontroller.
- Simulate the project in Proteus to visualize the hardware interactions.
- Connect to the ThingSpeak API to visualize and graph data, and store actual data.
- Use Postman to test the API endpoints.
- Deploy the project to DigitalOcean for cloud-based IoT solutions.
