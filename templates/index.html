          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to the ESP32 IoT project repository! This project combines
            the power of ESP32 microcontrollers, Proteus simulation, Arduino
            programming, Git version control, Postman for API testing, and
            DigitalOcean for cloud deployment. This was all done and made during
            the DA Hacks 2023 Hackathon from 10/20/2023 to 10/21/2023.

          <h2>Goals</h2>
          <h3>Short-term Goal</h3>
          <p>
            Our current mission is to increase awareness about the financial
            aspects related to using electronic devices, giving people the
            knowledge and resources to not only save electricity but also
            protect their finances. By shedding light on the connection between
            energy consumption and financial impact, our goal is to promote
            responsible energy use and ensure a brighter future for everyone.
          </p>
          <h3>Long-Term Goal</h3>
          <p>
            Our grand, long-term vision is to make a significant contribution to
            the global battle against climate change. We're striving to achieve
            this by providing a groundbreaking and effective approach to
            conserving electricity. In the process, our aim is to be a part of
            the solution that helps safeguard the Earth's invaluable resources,
            promoting sustainability and ensuring a healthy environment for
            generations to come.

          <h2>Usage</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Open the Arduino IDE and upload the provided ESP32 code to your
              microcontroller.
            </li>
            <li>
              Simulate the project in Proteus to visualize the hardware
              interactions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Connect to the ThingSpeak API to visualize and graph data, and
              store actual data.
            </li>
            <li>Use Postman to test the API endpoints.</li>
            <li>
              Deploy the project to DigitalOcean for cloud-based IoT solutions.
            </li>
          </ul>
